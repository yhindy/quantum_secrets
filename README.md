# Quantum Secrets

Quantum secrets is a Python implementation of two quantum secret sharing schemes. The first one is from [How To Share A Quantum Secret](https://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/9901025) and the second one is a custom one that we have created.

## Requirements

You must have pyquil 2.7.2 installed and numpy.

## Installation

Clone the repository onto your local machine. Before running any of the code, make sure you run the following command in a running terminal:

``` qvm -S ```

Once you have done this, you can run the cells in quantum_secrets.ipynb and nn_secrets.ipynb
